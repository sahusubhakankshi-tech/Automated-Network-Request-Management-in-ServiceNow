# Automated-Network-Request-Management-in-ServiceNow
This project builds an automated solution in ServiceNow to manage network service requests. Users submit requests via a self-service portal, which are validated, routed, and approved through workflows. Tasks, notifications, and automation tools handle fulfillment, reducing manual effort and speeding resolution.
